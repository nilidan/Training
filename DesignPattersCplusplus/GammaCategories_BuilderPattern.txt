Design Patterns are split into 3 categories called Gamma Categorization.

Creation Patters
  * Deal with the creation (contruction) of objects
  * Explicit like constructor vs implicit like Dependency INjection Reflection
  * Wholesale creation like a signal construction is enough or piecewise initilization

Structural Patterns
  * Concerned with the structure (clas members)
  * Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
  * Stress the imporatnce of good API design

Behavior Pattern
  *The are all differentm, following their own thing solve it partical way.

Bulder is when object construction is complicate, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

Motivation- 
-Some objects are simple and can be created in single constructor
-Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
-Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not production 
- Then it is better to opt for piecewise construction
